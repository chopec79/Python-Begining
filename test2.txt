Woot woot! So, this might be a little confusing. First, we open the file like expected. Next, we use the read(1), and notice that we provided an argument of 1, which just means we want to read the next character. So, Python prints out “I” for us because that is the first character in the test.txt file. What happens next is a little funky. We tell Python to read the entire file with read() because we did not provide any arguments. But, it doesn’t include that “I” that we just read!? It is because Python just picks up where it left off. So, if Python already read “I”, it will start reading from the next character. The reason for this is so you can cycle through a file without have to skip so many characters each time you want to read a new character. It’s complicated, I know, but think of reading like a one way process. Python is lazy, it doesn’t want to go back and reread contents. Let’s take this one step further with reading lines.
